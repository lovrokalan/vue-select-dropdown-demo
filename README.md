# vue-select-dropdown-demo
This is a demo of a vue dropdown select component with search functionality.
Live demo: https://stoic-wright-528f0a.netlify.app/

## DropdownSelect.vue component props:
### items
Array of values that are available for users selection.
This is the only required prop.

### searchInputPlaceholderText
String of text that is displayed as placeholder text of the search input.

### focusInputOnOpen
A Boolean value. Setting it to false will disable automatic focus on search input upon dropdown opening.
Setting false is suggested for mobile devices so that a touch keyboard doesn't show up unnecessarily.
